          <b>Scenario</b><br />
          <br />
          You are setting up as an independent consultant, which is very
          exciting, however, you’re going to need a website of your own to
          highlight your skills, availability and areas of work.<br />
          It’s time for you to create a website that details you, and including
          pages/sections and a how you built it page:<br />

          1.1 Describing the content and layout for each page<br />
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          My website is made up of 10 pages in total, It has 3 main pages, A
          ‘Homepage’ (index page), an ‘About Me’ page and a ‘Contact Me’
          page.<br />
          The fourth page is a ‘Projects’ page which is a gateway to a further 6
          pages, one for each Project Outcome.<br />
          All pages have the same header, navigation bar and footer, each
          section in every page has a thick border to give the website the feel
          of consistency.<br />
          The header together with the navigation bar always remain fixed and
          for a nicer effect, the scrolled page can be seen through the slightly
          transparent header background.<br />
          The navigation bar has 4 links that are highlighted when moused over,
          the Home, About me & Projects links are on the left of the bar the
          Contact Me link is on the right on its own for better emphasis.<br />
          All pages and navigation bar are sizeable including their content.<br />
          The footer is in the same background colour as the header and has a
          secondary link to the ‘Contact Me’ page.<br />
          The main ‘Projects’ page has 2 sections, one for each unit and within
          the section 3 buttons that link to the 3 outcomes of that unit.<br />
          The ‘About Me’ page has 4 sections, the first with my picture and some
          info about me, the other 3 sections detail my connection to computers,
          past, present, and future.<br />
          Finally, the ‘Contact Me’ page another image of me, my name, phone
          number and clickable links for sending me an email or launching a new
          tab with my LinkedIn page. <br />
          This page also has an enquiry form<br />

        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          Copyright and other intellectual property laws affect websites because
          it may restrict what you are able to publish. The best way to get
          around this is first, get permission from the original author, second,
          if you want to publish information on your site from another site,
          link to it and perhaps get permission to publish an excerpt from the
          original site.<br />

          1.6 Describing access issues that need taking into account - describe
          issues that people with disabilities may face when using webpages and
          how we can overcome them<br />
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          People with disabilities often use assistive technologies to access
          websites. A website that is accessible is designed to function
          properly with assistive technologies so that the information and
          functionality that is fundamental to the website is made accessible to
          every visitor. In some cases, such as in the case of colour blindness,
          no assistive technologies are used. Instead, websites that are
          accessible to these visitors consider these issues as they design
          their website and make proper use of visual elements.<br />

          1.7 Describe which are the appropriate filetypes for websites<br />
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          The 5 most common image formats for websites are JPEG, GIF, BMP, TIFF
          and PNG. The most popular out of the 5 is JPEG.<br />
          Other file formats that are used on websites are Mpeg, AVI and MP4 for
          video.<br />
          For text documents the most common formats are TXT, HTML and PDF<br />

        <br />
        <p>
          The importance of record-keeping and filing systems cannot be too
          highly stressed. A well-planned system contributes significantly to
          efficiency of operation as well as to a company's image. Whether
          records are filed in a computer or in a steel cabinet, they have to be
          readily accessible.

            Electronic files must be password encrypted and if they are emailed

            Files under the data protection act state you should not hold
