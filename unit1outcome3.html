          3.1 Review the benefits and drawbacks of IT tools and systems used in
          terms of productivity and efficiency – could you have been more
          efficient when making your website? How? Could you have done it in
          teams?<br />
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          The task of making a website single-handed or in a team has different
          requirements of IT tools and systems.<br />
          When we work as a team, we need more communication and project
          management tools. These are not that necessary when the work is done
          by one person, except perhaps a scheduling tool to keep track of work
          to be done.<br />
          If I was working as a team building my website, I would have delegated
          the work according to team ability and would have expected a more
          efficient effort.<br />

          3.2 Describe ways to improve productivity and efficiency<br />
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          You can improve productivity and efficiency by doing the following:
        </p>
        <ul class="b">
          <li>Plan your week in advance</li>
          <li>Delegate responsibility</li>
          <li>Think positively</li>
          <li>Communicate effectively</li>
          <li>Hold stand-up meetings</li>
          <li>Be a good example</li>
          <li>Give them incentives</li>
          <li>Use project management tools</li>
          <li>Integrate technology</li>
        </ul>
      </div>

          3.3 Develop solutions to improve own productivity using IT in digital
          projects – what would you do differently next time? Team work? Use of
          Slack?<br />
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          To improve my own productivity, I would plan as much as I can.<br />
          When working within a team, I would make use of communication tools
          like Slack and Zoom to get everyone involved and show the benefit and
          rewards of a team effort<br />

          3.4 Describe how you would go about testing digital solutions<br />
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          The more popular it is the more information there is about it
          online<br />
          I would go to various online forums and review websites and sites like
          YouTube, Bing, and Google to get as much information as possible. If
          required I would consider taking special training on a particular
          technology to be able to use it more efficiently<br />
