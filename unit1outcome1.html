          1.1 Describing the purpose of IT in modern business<br />
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          IT (Information technology) is the only technology which provides you
          the opportunity to analyse specific data and plan your business
          journey accordingly. Research from the last two decade has proved that
          those organisations that do invest in technology and choose the path
          of innovation increase their market share and overall competitiveness.
          The success of every business depends on certain factors. Some of
          which are accurate analysis, choosing the right technology and the
          future vision.<br />
          IT provides you many tools which can solve complex problems and plan
          the growth of your business. In the modern age, it is proved that
          digital marketing is a great tool which let you promote your products
          or services to the global market while sitting in the comfort of your
          remote office or home and thanks to cloud computing and modern
          communication which enable you to form a global organisation, manage
          and monitor its virtual offices all over the world.<br />

          1.2 Describing methods, skills and resources needed to complete
          digital projects successfully – what do you need to make projects
          successful? What tools? What skills?<br />
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          A digital project manager will need the following skills and resources
          to complete a project successfully:<br />
        </p>
        <ul class="b">
          <li>Draft meeting agendas and meeting notes</li>
          <li>Assign and schedule project tasks</li>
          <li>Schedule & lead project meetings</li>
          <li>Lead and direct project team members</li>
          <li>Prepare and monitor project schedules and budgets</li>
          <li>Manage project scope</li>
          <li>QA all project deliverables</li>
          <li>Contribute to client proposals & quotes</li>
          <li>Build project reports</li>
          <li>Assess and evaluate project success</li>
        </ul>
        <br />
        <p>
          All these tasks can be better accomplished using modern IT resources
          like:<br />
        </p>
        <ul class="b">
          <li>Slack business communication platform</li>
          <li>
            Trello Board application for to-do, doing, done progress management
            and Kanban style deadline meeting
          </li>
          <li>
            Zoom meetings online when face to face meetings are not possible
          </li>
          <li>Cloud data sharing</li>
          <li>GitHub and Bitbucket version control repositories</li>
        </ul>
        <br />
        <p>
          Currently Big data, Google Analytics and Microsoft CRM Dynamics are
          also great tools to extract useful information which can impact on
          decision making.<br />
          These online tools not only provide real time responses from the
          potential audience but also ensure the accuracy of data by minimising
          the risk of human errors.<br />

          The website must be fit for purpose, it will be useless if it does not
          follow business process.<br />
          All members of the business management team need to be on board with

          The website should be able to improve customer experience.<br />

          There are many technologies that can help a Technical Consultant and

          First analyse your business needs, what you already have and what is
          no longer useful.<br />
          Choose technology that grows with your business, research the type of
          technology similar businesses are using.<br />
          Always think in terms of need, only make changes and purchase devices
          that your business actually needs.<br />
          Have a backup plan in the event of technology disaster.<br />
          Get support on installation, upgrades, troubleshooting and security,
          make sure your staff are familiarised.<br />
          Training for your staff to use new technology acquired at optimum

          It was essential for me to have a reliable Desktop Computer that is
          reasonably fast connected to three monitors to be able to have the
          desired workspace to multitask between the various applications and
          web pages.<br />
          It is also essential to have a good broadband connection which is
          reliable and consistent.<br />
          I use a cloud-based storage facility which protects my data in case of
          a technology failure and gives me and my co-workers access to it from
          different locations.<br />
          I use Slack to communicate with my clients and co-workers through
          various Slack Channels depending on need.<br />
          I use Trello to create lists of tasks to be accomplished, delegate
          work as necessary and set deadlines for each task.<br />
          Git and GitHub are two different entities that help you manage and
          host files. Both entities offer Version Control System (VSC), a method
          used to save a file's versions for future reference. Also, tracking
          what changed, who changed it, and why it was changed. This illuminates
          the importance of a reliable and collaborative version control system
          like Git.<br />

          1.7 Describe legal guidelines and constraints that impact digital
          projects – How does GDPR impact digital projects?<br />
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          The General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) is an important European
          legislative framework that protects the collection and usage of EU
          consumers data by companies. The GDPR defines the rules for data
          management, the rights of the consumers, and the penalty details. The
          GDPR is all about how businesses should collect and use EU citizens
          data online through following guidelines:<br />
        </p>
        <ul class="b">
          <li>Organize your data</li>
          <li>Make sure the data is secure</li>
          <li>Collect only required data</li>
          <li>Be transparent and use clear language</li>
          <li>Positively opt-in</li>
          <li>Make it easy to opt-out</li>
        </ul>
        <br />
        <p>
          Email marketing and other digital marketing practices are having a
          direct impact since the implementation of GDPR. However, GDPR helps
          individuals to have full control over opt-in and opt-out for emails or
          any digital communications. Also, individuals can request for
          retrieval or deletion of their information stored in any form whether
          digital format or hard copy by the organizations.
