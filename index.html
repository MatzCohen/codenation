        <h4>Personal Review</h4>
        <br />
        <p id="smalltext">
          This is my very first website created by actual HTML coding using
          Visual Studio Code editor.<br />
          Through the knowledge I gained attending the Code Nation programming
          course I was able to do this without the use of a website building
          tools like Wix and BT website builder.<br />
          <br />
          I found Visual Studio Code very easy to use and a great editor for
          writing code in Python, HTML, CSS and many more.<br />
          I did not use Codepen but am aware of it and could use it in the
          future to help me build, test and discover front-end-code.<br />
          I have also managed to familiarise myself with the use of Trello for
          creating Kanban style tasks but think it is more useful in larger
          projects that require team collaboration.<br />
          <br />
          The website that I have created is very simple looking with all the
          necessary pages including an 'About Me' and 'Contact Me' page, a fixed
          header with a navigation bar and a footer.<br />
          I think it looks aesthetically pleasing and shows consistance across
          all pages. In the future I will change the colour scheme to give it a
          fresher look, this can be easily changed as all the colour information
          is kept in one CSS file.<br />
          <br />
          I will be making further improvements to the website in the future, I
          want to add a logo on the header, I will add more information to the
          Homepage, I will add a 'Gallery' section where I can show off my other
          work and I will add a 'Blog' section where I can post some of my
          experiences and get others to react to them.<br />
          I will also look to change some of the pages to utilise CSS Flexbox
          Properties which will make a more responsive website, containing a
          flexible navigation bar and flexible content.<br />
          <br />
          All in all, I think this website shows what can be achieved in less
          that a weeks tuition and is a good representation of myself.
