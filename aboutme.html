            My name is Matz Cohen, I live in London and currently looking to revive my passion in computer programming.<br>
            I am a collage graduate with a Diploma in Mechanical & Electrical engineering, I am very technically minded and always found it easy to “talk technology”.<br/>

        <h3>Nothing more than a hobby</h3>
        About 30 years ago I got my first PC and remember till today how I stayed up all night playing with it. I was so fascinated by it that I very quickly taught myself how to develop simple programs using the BASIC programming language.<br>
        Bit by bit I was attempting bigger projects and very soon after I was able to help a family friend who owned a retail shop with a program that helped him manage all aspects of his business, just by using a database application called DBase. The family friend used the software for many years and always commented how good it was.<br/>
        At the time, I was working in a partnership with my 3 brothers, a successful business but nothing to do with computers, and kept programming only as a hobby. Soon after that, I got married, had kids and my hobby was less important in my life.<br>

        <h3>A passion revived</h3>
        When last month, I found the opportunity to take a course in Python programming I was excited as it brought back many wonderful memories even though I did not have a clue what this language was.<br/>
        From the first day my eyes were glued to the monitor and took to it like duck to water. As if I already spoke Latin and now learning Italian<br/>
        I am still amazed that after only one week, I was able to write close to 500 lines of working code, in Python – a language I never knew existed a week before.<br/>

        <h3>Not just a hobby</h3>
        I now hope to re-connect with my long-time hobby and turn it into a source of income as well as a satisfying job.<br/>
